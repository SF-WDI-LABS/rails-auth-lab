# Simple Authentication with Bcrypt

>Adapted from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/thebucknerlife/10090014).

This tutorial is for adding authentication to a vanilla Ruby on Rails app using Bcrypt and has\_secure\_password.

The steps below are based on Ryan Bates's approach from [
Railscast \#250 Authentication from Scratch (revised)](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised).

You can see the final source code here: [repo](https://github.com/thebucknerlife/gif_vault). I began with a stock rails app using ``` rails new gif_vault ```

## Steps

1. Create a user model with a name, email and password\_digest (all strings) by entering the following command into the command line: ``` rails generate model user name email password_digest ```.

    *Note:* If you already have a user model or you're going to use a different model for authentication, that model must have an attribute named `password_digest` and some kind of attribute to identify the user (like an email or a username).
2. Run `rake db:migrate` in the command line to migrate the database.
3. Add these routes below to your `routes.rb` file. Notice I also deleted all the comments inside that file. Don't forget to leave the trailing `end`, though.

    ```ruby
    # config/routes.rb

    GifVault::Application.routes.draw do

        # This route sends requests to our naked url to the *cool* action in the *gif* controller.
        root to: 'gif#cool'

        # I've created a gif controller so I have a page I can secure later.
        # This is optional (as is the root to: above).
        get '/cool' => 'gif#cool'
        get '/sweet' => 'gif#sweet'

        # These routes will be for signup. The first renders a form in the browse, the second will
        # receive the form and create a user in our database using the data given to us by the user.
        get '/signup' => 'users#new'
        post '/users' => 'users#create'

    end
    ```

3. Create a users controller:

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/users_controller.rb

    class UsersController < ApplicationController

    end
    ```

4. Add a **new** action (for rendering the signup form) and a **create** action (for receiving the form and creating a user with the form's parameters.):

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/users_controller.rb

    class UsersController < ApplicationController

        def new
        end

        def create
        end   

    end
    ```

5. Now create the view file where we put the signup form.

    ```html+erb
    <!-- app/views/users/new.html.erb -->

    <h1>Signup!</h1>

    <%= form_for :user, url: '/users' do |f| %>

      Name: <%= f.text_field :name %>
      Email: <%= f.text_field :email %>
      Password: <%= f.password_field :password %>
      Password Confirmation: <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
      <%= f.submit "Submit" %>

    <% end %>
    ```
6. Add logic to the **create** action and add the private `user_params` method to sanitize the input from the form. You might need to adjust the parameters inside the `.permit()` method based on how you set up your User model.

    ```ruby
  class UsersController < ApplicationController

    def new
    end

    def create
      user = User.new(user_params)
      if user.save
        session[:user_id] = user.id
        redirect_to '/'
      else
        redirect_to '/signup'
      end
    end

  private

    def user_params
      params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
    end
  end
    ```

7. Go to your Gemfile and uncomment the 'bcrypt' gem. We need bcrypt to securely store passwords in our database.

    ```ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    # Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
    gem 'rails', '4.0.4'

    # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
    gem 'sqlite3'

    ...

    # Use ActiveModel has_secure_password
    gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'

    ...

    ```

7. Go to the User model file and add `has_secure_password`. This is the line of code that gives our User model authentication methods via bcrypt.

    ```ruby
    # app/models/user.rb

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

      has_secure_password

    end
    ```

9. Run `bundle install` from the terminal then restart your rails server.

10. Create a sessions controller. This is where we create (aka login) and destroy (aka logout) sessions.

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb

    class SessionsController < ApplicationController

      def new
      end

      def create
      end

      def destroy
      end

    end
    ```

11. Create a form for users to login with.

    ```html+erb
    <!-- app/views/sessions/new.html.erb -->

    <h1>Login</h1>

    <%= form_tag '/login' do %>

      Email: <%= text_field_tag :email %>
      Password: <%= password_field_tag :password %>
      <%= submit_tag "Submit" %>

    <% end %>
    ```

12. Update your routes file to include new routes for the sessions controller.

    ```ruby
    # config/routes.rb
    GifVault::Application.routes.draw do

      root to: 'gif#cool'

      # these routes are for showing users a login form, logging them in, and logging them out.
      get '/login' => 'sessions#new'
      post '/login' => 'sessions#create'
      get '/logout' => 'sessions#destroy'

      get '/signup' => 'users#new'
      post '/users' => 'users#create'

    end
    ```

13. Update the sessions_controller with the logic to log users in and out.

    ```ruby
      # app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb

      def create
        user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
        # If the user exists AND the password entered is correct.
        if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
          # Save the user id inside the browser cookie. This is how we keep the user
          # logged in when they navigate around our website.
          session[:user_id] = user.id
          redirect_to '/'
        else
        # If user's login doesn't work, send them back to the login form.
          redirect_to '/login'
        end
      end

      def destroy
        session[:user_id] = nil
        redirect_to '/login'
      end
    ```

14. Update the application controller with new methods to look up the user, if they're logged in, and save their user object to a variable called `@current_user`. The `helper_method` line below `current_user` allows us to use `@current_user` in our view files. Authorize is for sending someone to the login page if they aren't logged in. This is how we keep certain pages our site secure: users have to login before seeing them.

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
      # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception

      def current_user
        @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]
      end
      helper_method :current_user

      def authorize
        redirect_to '/login' unless current_user
      end

    end
    ```

15. Add a `before_filter` to any controller that you want to secure. This will force users to login before they can see the actions in this controller. This gif controller is secure because it includes `before_filter`. The routes for this controller were added to `routes.rb` in the beginning of this tutorial.

    ```ruby
    # app/controllers/gif_controller.rb

    class GifController < ApplicationController

      before_filter :authorize

      def cool
      end

      def free
      end

    end
    ```

16. You can update your application layout file to show the user's name and some contextual links if they're logged in.

    ```html+erb
    <!-- app/views/layout/application.html.erb -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      ...
    </head>
    <body>

    <% if current_user %>
      Signed in as <%= current_user.name %> | <%= link_to "Logout", '/logout' %>
    <% else %>
      <%= link_to 'Login', '/login' %> | <%= link_to 'Signup', '/signup' %>
    <% end %>

    <%= yield %>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```
